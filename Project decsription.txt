GRPC scaling for matrix multiplication 

This project was by using the divide and conquer method for matrix multiplication.

In the grpc server, 8 instances were used.

functions such as addBlock and multiplyBlock were used and in the user side over 
the front end 2 .txt files can be uploaded as input with matrices in them to 
get the output.

these input files are uploaded to the REST API and then the rest api uses the grpc server to call our
functions in the server

this is where the scaling part comes in, the number of instances to which our client connects is calculated 
by the iteration of footprint, number of calls being made and deadline given.

the two files uploaded as inputs must have the following:
rows separated by new lines
numbers separated by spaces
.txt extensions
matrices with dimensions in the power of 2.



to execute 

npm run server:grpc
npm run serber:rest

local host ---- 8080.
